# Cusine-Courier-DataBase-Project-

This project focuses on creating an e-commerce platform for food items. Using Java Spring Boot as the core for server-side processing, Java Swing for the user interface, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for front-end development, we aim to deliver a secure and user-friendly experience. Key features include admin privileges for managing restaurants and user databases, robust user authentication with encrypted passwords, efficient product listing using Java Collections, and seamless shopping cart management with dynamic price calculation. The three-tier architecture ensures scalability and maintainability, utilizing PostgreSQL for backend data storage. Testing encompasses user registration, login processes, product listing, navigation, and shopping cart management. The expected outcome is a successful platform that offers secure, efficient, and enjoyable food item purchasing for users.
